/** \ingroup core
 * \class QgsStatisticalSummary
 * \brief Calculator for summary statistics for a list of doubles.
 *
 * Statistics are calculated by calling calculate() and passing a list of doubles. The
 * individual statistics can then be retrieved using the associated methods. Note that not all statistics
 * are calculated by default. Statistics which require slower computations are only calculated by
 * specifying the statistic in the constructor or via setStatistics().
 *
 * \since QGIS 2.9
